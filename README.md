# My Digital Garden
The concept of a [digital garden](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) immediately grabbed me, because I have always been data-hoarding my entire life anyways, either via note taking tools like [Notion.so](https://notion.so) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com) or even a vast collection of bookmarks in [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io).

But it wasn't until I saw [Nikita Voloboev's](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) repository that I fell in love with the concept of digital gardens and I wanted to start my own.

So here it is. It all starts small, like a real garden, but over time this will grow.
